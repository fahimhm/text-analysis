    "## Getting and Cleaning the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "This notebook goes through a necessary step of data project: getting the data and then do the data cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be walking through:\n",
    "1. Getting the data - we will be scraping data from a website\n",
    "2. Cleaning the data - we will walk through text-cleaning techniques\n",
    "3. Organizing the data - we will organize the cleaned data into a way that is easy to input into other algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "The ouput of this notebook will be clean, organized data in two standard text formats:\n",
    "1. Corpus - a collection of text\n",
    "2. Document-Term Matrix - word counts in matrix format\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "My goal is look at transcripts of various speakers and note their similiarities and differences. Specifically, I'd like to know if Donald Trump's speech style is different than other speakers, since he's a controversial Man.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the Data\n",
    "There are many web that keep track of speech transcript of public figure. I randomly pick whose speech I will analyze, and I think it's free if I decide to add more."
